# ExportLabbook
OneNote labbook export and backup tool

You need to download the pdfsharp dll file from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfsharp/ and place it in the same folder than the export script. 

To make the magic happen, you need to install the onenote-powershell adaptor. You can get the *.msi file for that from: http://cid-83dfdc4530b17dd8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Open%20Source%20Projects/OneNotePowershell.msi
